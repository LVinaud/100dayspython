# 100dayspython
I don't expect to be going for a consecutive 100 days streak but rather do a whole class each week or so on a day that I've more free time as I also need to conciliate with college classes. I'm using the Dr. Angela Yu 100 days course to learn python, so far its being great!

I expect to showcase my progress here, my number 1 reason for starting this is python's importance in data science and machine learning, also its a great skill to have.
