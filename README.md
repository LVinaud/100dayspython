# 100dayspython
I don't expect to be going for a consecutive 100 days streak but rather do a whole class each week or so on a day that I have more free time as I also need to conciliate with college classes. I'm using the Dr. Angela Yu 100 days course to learn python, so far its being great!

I expect to showcase my progress here, my number 1 reason for starting this is python's importance in data science and machine learning, also its a great skill to have.

## Day 1
Honestly, I am the kind of person that likes to start at the beggining, so although I could've skipped this, it doesn't hurt to do the simple things. 

well, in python there's no f in the print function, that's something to notice haha. Something actually new to me is that in python you can use both '' and "" to indicate strings. also using the input() function inside other functions is something different from c as scanf would return the number of characters read. Variables apparently don't need their type when declaring them. You can concatenate strings with the + sign and adequate indentation is essential. 

## Day 2
